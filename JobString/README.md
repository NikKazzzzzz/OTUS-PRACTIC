# Linked List Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a doubly linked list in Go. The linked list supports basic operations such as adding elements to the front or back, removing elements, and iterating through the list.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single file:

- `main.go`: Contains the definitions of the `Item` and `List` structures, their associated methods, and the `main` function that demonstrates the usage of the linked list.

## Getting Started

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/linked-list-project.git
    cd linked-list-project
    ```

2. Ensure you have the `main.go` file in the project directory:

    ```plaintext
    linked-list-project/
    └── main.go
    ```

### Running the Project
